/* Design a class named Person and its two subclasses named Student and Employee.
Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee.
A person has a name, address, phone number, and email address.
A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior). Define the status as a constant.
An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate classto create an object for date hired.
A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title.
Override the output() method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.
